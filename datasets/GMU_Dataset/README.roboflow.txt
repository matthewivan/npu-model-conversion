The dataset includes 6428 images.
Balls are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 160x160 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 6 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -13 and +13 percent
* Random exposure adjustment of between -12 and +12 percent
